# Server-Side Technical Interview: Workflow Automation System Backend

## Introduction

Welcome to the server-side technical interview for our Workflow Automation System! Today, we'll be focusing on developing the backend infrastructure to support the frontend workflow management system. Our goal is to assess your ability to design and implement a robust, scalable, and efficient backend solution.

## Project Scope

We'll be working on creating a backend API that supports the following key functionalities:
1. Workflow management (CRUD operations)
2. Node type definitions and management
3. Workflow execution engine
4. Data processing and storage
5. Integration with external APIs

## Interview Format

1. **Collaborative Environment**: You'll be working alongside one of our senior backend engineers who will act as both a collaborator and an evaluator.

2. **Resources**: Feel free to use online resources, documentation, or AI assistants as needed. We value your ability to find and apply information efficiently.

3. **Technology Stack**: You're free to choose the technology stack you're most comfortable with. Popular choices include Node.js with Express, Python with Flask or FastAPI, or Java with Spring Boot.

4. **Database**: Select an appropriate database system. Consider the needs of the application (e.g., relational vs. NoSQL).

5. **API Design**: We'll start by designing the API endpoints needed to support the frontend operations.

6. **Implementation**: We'll implement key components of the system, focusing on core functionalities.

7. **Testing**: We'll discuss and potentially implement unit tests for critical components.

8. **Scalability and Performance**: We'll discuss strategies for ensuring the system can handle increased load and complex workflows.

## Project Steps

1. **Requirements Gathering and Architecture Discussion (30 minutes)**
   - Discuss the overall system architecture and how the backend fits into it
   - Clarify any questions about the project requirements
   - Explore potential challenges and discuss possible solutions
   - Make key architecture decisions (e.g., synchronous vs asynchronous processing, stateless vs stateful design)
   - Discuss integration points with the frontend and any external systems

2. **API Design (15-20 minutes)**
   - Design RESTful API endpoints for workflow and node CRUD operations
   - Discuss authentication and authorization strategies
   - Plan endpoints for workflow execution and status monitoring

3. **Data Model Design (10-15 minutes)**
   - Design the data model for workflows, nodes, and execution results
   - Discuss database choice and schema design

4. **Core Implementation (45-60 minutes)**
   - Set up the project and basic server structure
   - Implement key API endpoints (e.g., create workflow, add node, execute workflow)
   - Create a basic workflow execution engine

5. **Advanced Features (if time permits) (20-30 minutes)**
   - Implement branching logic in the workflow execution engine
   - Design a plugin system for custom node types
   - Develop a caching strategy for frequently accessed workflows

6. **Testing and Documentation (15-20 minutes)**
   - Write unit tests for critical components (e.g., workflow execution engine)
   - Document API endpoints and usage

7. **Scalability Discussion (10-15 minutes)**
   - Discuss strategies for horizontal scaling
   - Consider options for handling long-running workflows
   - Explore potential bottlenecks and solutions

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Requirements Understanding**: Ability to ask relevant questions and make informed architecture decisions
2. **API Design**: Clarity, RESTfulness, and completeness of the API design
3. **Code Quality**: Readability, structure, and adherence to best practices
4. **Problem-Solving**: Approach to challenges and ability to break down complex problems
5. **Database Design**: Appropriate schema design and database choice
6. **Scalability Considerations**: Understanding of potential scaling issues and solutions
7. **Testing Approach**: Quality and coverage of unit tests
8. **Documentation**: Clarity and completeness of API documentation
9. **Communication**: Ability to explain design choices and trade-offs

Remember, the goal is not necessarily to complete every aspect of the system but to demonstrate your thought process, problem-solving skills, and ability to create robust and scalable backend solutions. Good luck!
